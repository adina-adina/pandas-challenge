Overall, charter schools perform much better than district schools.  And this is very interesting considering that charter schools spend considerably less per student capita than district schools do.  It is difficult to say with certainty how much this depends on school size.  The largest charter school's (Wilson) performance numbers are in line with the other charter schools.  However, it still has 500 less students than 7 of the district schools, out of 15 schools in total.  More study is necessary to determine the impacts of school type vs. school size on exam performance.

It is also noteworthy that math and reading scores are consistent across grades for each school.  This indicates that the strengths and weaknesses contributing to each school's overall academic performance are systemic for each school, rather than resulting from indindividual teacher performance or grade-level curricula.
